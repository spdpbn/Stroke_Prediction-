According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.Doctors can predict patients' risk for ischemic stroke based on the severity of their metabolic syndrome, a conglomeration of conditions that includes high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels and excess body fat around the abdomen and waist, a new study finds.

Here i have used EDA i.e, Exploratory Data Analysis which is method of examining dataset from which we can learn charecteristics of data

i have also used dataprep.eda package which makes data analysis very easy using simple api.
using this library we can achieve detailed report of every categorical value.

finally i have tested different machine learning algorithms to achieve good accuracy i prediction.
